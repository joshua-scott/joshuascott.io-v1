Hi. I'm Josh, a web developer and third year Information Technology student at Turku University of Applied Sciences. 

I grew up in Yorkshire, England, and previously studied English Language and Linguistics at the University of York. I then spent my early twenties working as a Training and Activities Manager, where I was responsible for the daytime activities and entertainment in TUI hotels across northern Africa and the Canary Islands. In 2013, I moved to London to teach high school English through the charity Teach First, while also completing a Masters in Leadership at University College London.

I've always had a passion for computers and technology, and in 2015 decided to pursue a career in programming. This led me to Turku, arguably the most beautiful city in Southwest Finland(!). After cutting my teeth with C and C#, I grew more interested in the world of web development. Soon this interest developed into an obsession, and after learning the basics of frontend web development, I spent most of 2017 learning how to build modern web apps using ES6 JavaScript and related technologies such as Vue, React, Node, Webpack, Babel, Sass (and a few others along the way).

I've done a little freelance work which has given me some practical experience, and in 2018 I'd like to find a part-time developer role in Turku that would work well alongside my studies. If you know of any companies that are looking to hire, get in touch!
