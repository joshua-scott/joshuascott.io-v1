My first 'real-world' project was to build the website for a local(ish) company called Lappi-Hunaja.

I worked on this with two of my classmates at uni, and really enjoyed it. I'd only begun 'properly' learning web development around 2-3 months before, and it accelerated my learning *hugely*. There were plenty of challenges to solve along the way, many of which I'd never encountered before. How best to integrate multiple languages (with automatic selection based on browser preferences)? A calendar with a search feature? One of those annoying 'subscribe to our email' popups (sorry, world!), that doesn't bother the user *too* much? Photo galleries? An integrated map? A customer survey? An easy way for the business to update the site (CRM)? How should all the data be stored? How to *deploy* the site when it's ready? We were complete noobs and I loved it.

We learned a lot from each other, and gradually managed to overcome these challenges. It taught me a lot about perseverance in development; I genuinely didn't think we could do it, but we did. Looking back, I'm also glad we *didn't* use any of the hip new frameworks and technologies I had unsuccessfully advocated at the time; I learned a lot about the way websites had been built for a long time until those frameworks came along, and I think I'm a better developer as a result. Programming aside, I also developed my ability to work with a business client, and all the 'soft skills' that come with that. Overall, a really valuable experience!
