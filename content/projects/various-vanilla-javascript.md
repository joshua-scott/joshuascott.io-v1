**Completed in:**

+ Winter 2016 - Summer 2017

**Technologies used:**

+ ES6 JavaScript
+ Sass
+ A whole bunch of tooling and other important stuff (things like Git, Gulp, ESLint, Babel etc)


Before learning any kind of hot framework such as React or Vue, I wanted to ensure I had a solid grasp of the fundamentals of ES6 JavaScript and direct DOM manipulation. So, I intentionally limited myself to vanilla JavaScript until I felt confident in building interactive websites. Above are links to some of those projects. Most of these projects were inspired by the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum. The JavaScript30 one is a course by [Wes Bos](https://javascript30.com), in which you make 30 fun little projects. I found this to be a great resource to transition from *understanding* the language, to being able to use it in 'real world' scenarios.
